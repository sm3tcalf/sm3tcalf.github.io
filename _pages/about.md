### Hey! My name is Sam Metcalf, and I'm currently a master's student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the [Department of City and Regional Planning](https://planning.unc.edu/). 

I’m particularly focused on housing and community development, and finding smart and equitable solutions to solving the housing crisis.

I’m originally from Denver, Colorado, where I grew to love living in the city and learned to appreciate the importance of walkable and equitable environments. Since arriving at UNC, I’ve studied these issues extensively etc etc ADD MORE HERE

Aside from my coursework, I’m also a member of the Tarpeggios, a co-ed acapella group at UNC… you can stream our most recent album [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XMETYH0wL2F3qDpWfVKzw?si=VrvuOPSGTauOjsTfjMlvNg). I’m also a member of BuildUP, an urban planning student organization for undergrads at UNC.

In my free time, you’ll probably catch me learning a bass line for the Tarps or watching Jeopardy. I’m also a big fan of UNC basketball and, [unfortunately, the Rockies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyblengino/2023/05/05/colorado-rockies-might-be-the-most-hopeless-franchise-in-american-sports/?sh=30610192c925). At least Carolina is fun to root for.

You can find my CV [here](./cv.md) and my portfolio [here](./portfolio.html). And, if I ever get around to it, my blog [here](./year-archive.html).
